# About the project

After learning online course from the Data Camp, I think all the programming languages are essentially the same. R is very similar to Python, and some functions are just like one the the Python library (Pandas), since they all use Dataframe object to store information, so I find it very easy to understand, and I think R is focused on the data processing where as Python is more of general purpose type of language.
