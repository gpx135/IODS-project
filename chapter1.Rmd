# About the project

After learning online course from the Data Camp, I think all the programming languages are essentially the same. R is very similar to Python, and some functions are just like one the the Python library (Pandas), since they all use Dataframe object to store information, so I find it very easy to understand, and I think R is focused on the data processing where as Python is more of general purpose type of language.

Some notes about the R language:
- R is an open source language which mean free of charge and everyone can use it. In the field of statistical analysis, it is very convienient to manipulate the data. R's basic data types are character, numeric, integer, complex, and logical. R's basic data structures include the vector, list, matrix, data frame, and factors.
